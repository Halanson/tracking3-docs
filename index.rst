About
-----

Tracking3.io is an asset and production management application for creative teams working in animation, live-action, commercial and image movie industries, as well as visual FX and games.

We designed Tracking3 to work well as a film production software. We support you in your daily life by tracking and managing your tasks and the tasks of your artists while pushing your project through the creative process of making awesome films. We make it easy for your team to see what has been done and what needs to be done next.

In our simple to use and intuitive web app, you can organize your production pipeline and assets as you like and integrate your local pipeline with our `JSON REST API <https://tracking3.io/en/support/api>`_ to work seamlessly together. We have set our focus on a high amount of automation and we will continue with more automation features in future releases. This way, we power your production pipeline to a new level.

We offer you a completely free version of our film management software for a maximum of three users. We also provide some demo projects for an easier start, so check out how it looks and feel.

Getting Started
---------------


To start using Tracking3, you need to `sign up <https://www.tracking3.io/user/sign-up>`_ for an account and log in after you have confirmed your account.


Create a Project
================

In the `app <https://app.tracking3.io/>`_ go to **Create > Project** and follow the given instructions. You can invite up to two other people to join your project immediately for free. If you like to add more users, you need to create an organisation and subscribe for more user licences.

You can choose a project template for an easier start with already some basic project structure and settings in place. Of course, you adjust all of these settings to your need afterwards.

Once done, you have a new folder in the left navigation bar with the name of your project. That is the place you will find all settings, users, assets, files and any other kind of information of your project.


Create your Pipeline
====================

We use :doc:`Asset Definitions</docs/Project/Settings/AssetDefinition/index>` to describe what :doc:`Attributes</docs/Project/Settings/Attribute/index>` an asset has. So if you have multiple types of assets you need to have multiple types of **Asset Definitions** describing your asset. Both, **Asset Definitions** and **Attributes** you will find in your project folder in the left navigation bar, go to **Settings > Asset Definitions** to edit them.


Create the Project Structure
============================

Within your project, in the left navigation bar, you will find **Settings > Views**. Left-click on **Views** to open it. You can find more information on **Views** on :doc:`this page</docs/Project/Settings/View/index>`. All views you create will be shown in the left navigation bar, regardless of what type they are.


Create Assets
=============

Once you have at least one **Asset Definition** and a **View** of type **Grid** you can start adding assets to your project. Open a **View** of type **Grid** by clicking at it on the left navigation bar. The data grid appears empty because no assets have been added. Only the grids header shows the **Attributes** you have added to this **View**.

At the top left corner of the data grid, you will find a **New** button. Left-click it to create an asset. You need to select the **Asset Definition** you like to create because this dialogue is not bound to the **Asset Definition** the **View** uses. Enter a name and may other required fields and you are good to go for your first asset.
